Here are some lab tasks on user-defined exceptions that could help students understand how to
define and handle custom exceptions:
Bank Account Management

    ○ Create a BankAccount class with a method to withdraw money.
    ○ Define custom exceptions like InsufficientFundsException and
    NegativeAmountException.
    ○ If a user tries to withdraw more than the balance, throw
    InsufficientFundsException.
    ○ If the amount is negative, throw NegativeAmountException.
